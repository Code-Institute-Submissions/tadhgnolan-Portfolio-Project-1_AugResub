                        Having played plenty of Ghost Recon Breakpoint I can safely say somthing was lost in the
                        intervening years. The sequel to Ghost Recon Wildlands just doesn't have anything like the
                        beautiful & cohesive landscapes found in its predecessor. Maybe this comes from its setting
                        being a completely fictional sci-fi New Zealand<span id="dots3">...</span><span class="more"
                            id="more3">, unlike Wildlands reality inspired Bolivia, which actually landed Ubisoft in a
                            bit of hot water with that country's government over its portrayal of drug cartels & corrupt
                            officials. I never took it as anything realistic, but I could see quite a few things that
                            would irk anyone from Bolivia upon viewing. There's definitely a few stereotypes beign
                            bandied about. Anyway, regardless, 4 years after it's release Wildlands still manages to be
                            a very entertaining game, especially with a squad of friends in co-op. It really seemed they
                            were on to something good, whichh is what makes the initial disaster that was Breakpoint
                            even more confusing.</span>
