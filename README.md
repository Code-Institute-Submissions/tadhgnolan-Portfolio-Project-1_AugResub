### User Stories

End users will be consumers looking for opinions regarding the quality of video games which they may wish to purchase.

* As a user I would like the articles/videos to be quickly accessible with minimal presses/clicks.

* As a user I would like the stories to be readable on the go (on the bus, in a cafe etc.)

* As a user I would like to be able to access new articles first and previous stories in a clearly ordered fashion.

* As a user I would like to have access to social media links to what the creator is working on & media that interests them or is related to the sites content.

### Testing

All testing performed before and after each commit.

Repeated real world testing performed with Google Pixel 3aXL (2160 × 1080px), Nokia 3 (720 x 1280), Asus Nexus 7 (1920 x 1200px) & Desktop PC (1920 x 1080px + 2560 × 1440) representing a mixture of age plus hardware capability & were readily available.

In Chrome Dev Tools, tested repeatedly with all available presets

This functionality testing involved:

- Verifying all navbar & other links functioned as expected.

- Using Chrome Dev Tools Elements tab to test out small styling changes before adding.

- Checking that fonts scaled correctly for each display size.

- Checking for overflow.

- Tested html & CSS at https://validator.w3.org. (srcset attribute was being used unnecessarily. Used auto as a value for padding-left property. Removed. Used xxx-large as a value for font property instead of font-size. Rectified).

- Testing with Lighthouse. Final score 74. (main issue was due to large image sizes. Unfortunately I was unable to compress images further without pixelization).
