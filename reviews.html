                        So far I've been having a good time with this dlc. I may be slightly biased, living in the city
                        where you first step ashore. Apart from the novelty factor of trying to find the rough location
                        of my flat in the 9th Century game world, <span id="dots4">...</span><span class="more"
                            id="more4">it does seem like simply more of what Assassin's Creed Valhalla already
                            had to offer, with some variety added by the new druidic faction & their hallucinogenic form
                            of
                            combat. That may be a good or a bad thing depending on where you stand. I did find myself
                            getting worn out by a lot of the busy work in the previous entry, Odyssey. I'm finding
                            nothing
                            that's putting me off so far, so we'll see how it goes when I get around to a full
                            review.</span>

                        I'm having an absolute blast retracing Shepard's adventures in glorious HD. The 3 studios
                        involved have done an excellent job remastering the series, given their constraints. It really
                        does have the effect of turning your rose-tinted nostalgic memories into reality.<span
                            id="dots5">...</span><span class="more" id="more5">After a few hours you also start to
                            realise the quality of stroytelling present in the game is somthing that's not really
                            present anymore in modern gaming, with the chase for ever larger open worlds & reliance on
                            procedural gerneration for npc quests & adventures. There's some amazing storytelling here &
                            I only hope it will inspire some younger players experiencing it for the first time, who
                            then perhaps go on to become devs themselves. Anyway, like I stated already, I'm having an
                            absolute blast, even if I know it'll probably take me another year or so to complete. I will
                            be back with a review at that stage, but I'm going to take my time and enjoy it</span>
